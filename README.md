# ðŸ“Š Sales Performance Analysis

**Tools Used:** Power BI Desktop, MySQL, Excel  
**Dataset:** AdventureWorksDW (Cleaned & Transformed)



## Setup

This project was developed using MySQL (adapted from SQL Server) and Power BI Desktop.  
Raw transactional sales and budget data from **AdventureWorksDW** was cleansed and transformed using SQL scripts.  
The data was exported to Excel and loaded into Power BI for visualization.

**SQL Logic Included:**
- `LEFT JOIN`, `CASE` statements, aliasing, and `ISNULL()` for cleaning customer and geography data
- Combined and exported clean tables for reporting



## Business Request & User Stories

**Business Objective:**  
Track actual vs. budgeted sales, highlight top-performing customers/products, and monitor trends by region and category.

**User Stories:**
- As a **business manager**, I want to compare monthly sales vs. budget.
- As a **sales analyst**, I want to identify top 10 customers and products to plan retention and upsell strategies.



## Data Cleaning with MySQL

**Key Transformations:**
- Created cleaned dimensional tables (`DimCustomer`, `DimGeography`) using `LEFT JOIN`
- Used `CASE` to convert gender codes (M, F) to readable labels
- Combined `firstname` + `lastname` â†’ Full Name
- Exported clean data to CSV for Power BI



## Dashboard Development in Power BI

**Steps Followed:**
- Imported cleaned CSV files into Power BI
- Built relationships using primary keys (Customer, Product, Geography)
- Added `Fact_Budget` to compare targets with actual sales
- Created DAX measures (e.g., `Actual vs Budget Difference`)
- Added filters for City, Month, Product Category
